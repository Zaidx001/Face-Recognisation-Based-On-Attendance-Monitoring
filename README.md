Developed an automated attendance system using real-time face recognition to identify and log individuals.
Implemented image processing and facial recognition using Python libraries (face
_
recognition and OpenCV), achieving
accurate detection under varied lighting conditions.
Built a face encoding and matching pipeline to compare live video input with a dataset of registered faces.
Designed an efficient logging mechanism to record timestamps and prevent duplicate entries per session usingÂ CSV
files.
